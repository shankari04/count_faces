Face Counting System using OpenCV and Python
This project is a computer vision application that automatically detects and counts the number of human faces appearing in a video or image using OpenCV. It can be applied in areas like surveillance, event monitoring, or audience analytics.

🔍 Features
Detects and counts all visible faces in images or video files

Displays the total number of detected faces in real time

Works with both static images and video streams

User-friendly output display with bounding boxes

🛠️ Technologies Used
Python

OpenCV (for face detection using Haar cascades or DNN)

NumPy (for array operations)

Jupyter Notebook / .py script (based on your setup)

🚀 How It Works
Load the image or video file

Convert frames to grayscale

Use OpenCV’s pre-trained face detection model

Count and draw bounding boxes around each detected face

Display the count and the annotated frame
